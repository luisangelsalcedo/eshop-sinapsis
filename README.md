# eshop-sinapsis

Technical challenge for the Synapsis Group for frontend position.
This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.6.

To develop this challenge, I used **the Fake Shop API** [https://fakestoreapi.com/docs](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs) to facilitate data collection.
